In Data Clustering, a key challenge is identifying cluster centroids that form compact and well-separated clusters. To address this challenge, this work proposes the hybrid opposition-based improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (HOB-iPSO) for partitional data clustering. HOB-iPSO employs a hybrid approach for initializing cluster centroids by integrating random estimation, quasi-opposition-based learning, and K-Means to improve exploration capability, maintaining diversity and identifying various promising regions in the high-dimensional feature space. Moreover, HOB-iPSO balances exploration and exploitation using logistic map-based chaotic inertia weight, promoting stable convergence of cluster centroids toward global optima.
